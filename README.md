# BMI Calculator

This is a simple Java program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the user's height and weight. The program prompts the user to enter their height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms) and then calculates the BMI value. Afterward, the program categorizes the BMI into different health ranges and gives feedback on the user's category.

## Features

- Takes user input for height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms).
- Calculates the BMI value based on the formula: `BMI = weight / (height * height)`.
- Categorizes the BMI into one of the following: Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obese, or Severely Obese.
- Input validation to ensure valid, positive numeric inputs.
- Gracefully handles incorrect input types using try-catch blocks.
- Asks the user if they want to perform another calculation after each result.
